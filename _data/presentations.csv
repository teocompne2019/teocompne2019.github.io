Tuesday,10:30:00,1,talk,bfoxall,Ben Foxall,Serving CSV from the Browser,"Our web browsers are powerful tools for requesting, processing, and displaying CSV data in an open way. Though, as well as reading files, the web platform has the capability to generate CSV (or other formats) right in the browser. We’ll look at the advantages of doing this rather than using a traditional web service or script.  I’ll show the browser features that make this possible now, and the ones that will make it even better in the future.",
Tuesday,10:30:00,2,talk,rsmithunna,Richard Smith-Unna,"Easy, massive-scale reuse of scientific outputs","I will present new open tools that enable easy, massive-scale analysis and reuse of the scientific literature and other outputs. These tools are optimised for non-technical users, but rest on a platform of components for power users. I will share lessons learned in the development process, and highlight pain-points that can guide data creation and curation efforts.",
Tuesday,10:30:00,3,talk,srenton,Scott Renton,Describing Image Collections (Without Any Staff!),"The University of Edinburgh’s ""Library and University Collections"" is very proud of its high-resolution images of the wealth of Special Collections it holds.
The discovery of these images is handled by the LUNA Imaging platform, a supplied system, which allows high quality JP2K zooming, and also presents its metadata using robust solr indices.
Getting the data into the application has presented us with a number of interesting challenges. To briefly describe this workflow: our Photographers receive readers’ orders from items they have found in our manuscripts, and these are recorded using Excel worksheets (we have offered to move the whole process to the web but for various reasons, this has not happened!); we take the shorthand data that they record and turn it into presentation standard, using an Excel macro which features various programming techniques; this macro also runs file renames, and runs a process to embed identification data into the TIFFs. From here, per collection CSVs are generated for upload to the system, which parses the particular CSV into the relevant format under the covers; this gives us a skeleton record in the LUNA system.
As we do not have cataloguers devoted to our images, we need to be creative to enrich the records to make them searchable. We have built a purpose-built crowdsourcing application based on standard LAMP technologies to allow the crowd to further catalogue the record. The data is then hived off to the correct standard using JSON or XML, and run back in using processes we’ve built around the system’s REST API.
This end-to-end workflow has grown organically, does everything we need it to do, and has CSV at its very heart.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BY93dL-HGI

Tuesday,11:00:00,1,talk,kwhite,K Adam White,WordPress as Data,"Over the past two years we have been building a new JSON-based REST API for WordPress. Available today as a plugin, that API could be integrated into a core WordPress release as early as later this year—and with the reach WP has globally, that would mean a ""quarter of the Internet"" (as WP likes to bill its market share; see W3Techs) would suddenly have unprecedented access to their own content in a structured data format. I want to share the goals we have had while working on the WP-API project and its client libraries, and to open a discussion about how to educate users that they will have access to their data in this way—and that third parties may, as well.",
Tuesday,11:00:00,3,talk,rjones,Richard Jones,CSV as the Master Dataset - and approaches to web publishing,"Websites which provide search and data analysis/visualisation capabilities to end-users can be costly and time-consuming to build, not least because custom back-ends for data management are often complex.  Small organisations managing niche datasets understand and use spreadsheets well, but this creates barriers to publicising their information in visual and interactive ways.  At [Cottage Labs](http://cottagelabs.com) we're working on a patchwork of open source tools borrowed, stitched together or enhanced to bridge that gap, and enable these organisations to keep and manage their master data as CSVs (or any other sheet format they like), then to get it online and into their websites to engage their communities.  This talk will cover the common challenges (both technical and human), the data transformations, and the generalised approach to visualisations that makes this process quick and economical.  We'll show a couple of examples in the wild, including [SPARC's](http://sparcopen.org/) [Open Access Spectrum](http://oaspectrum.org/) and the [World Nuclear Association's](http://www.world-nuclear.org/) [Reactor Database](http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/facts-and-figures/reactor-database.aspx).",
Tuesday,11:30:00,1,talk,kmckelvey,Karissa McKelvey,Distributing Open Data with Dat,"Distributing data with a centralized server can often be expensive and difficult to maintain. If we instead use a decentralized or 'flat' network, we can drastically increase bandwidth and ensure uptime by connecting those who download data with peers who already have it. Dat is a data tool for distributing datasets, small and large. Attendees will learn how to create a versioned data package with Dat and distribute it via an open network. This workshop will leave attendees with a superior tool for ensuring integrity, uptime, and bandwidth for open data.",
Wednesday,11:30:00,1,talk,dfowler,Dan Fowler,Data Packages and Frictionless Data for Research,"Data-driven work is an ever-increasing part of research. At the same time, there is very significant friction around the acquisition, sharing and reuse of data. Based on working both with researchers and government for more than a decade on the issues surrounding data sharing and use, we have identified a specific subproblem which is both significant and tractable: the development and adoption of a lightweight specification and associated tooling for “packaging” (tabular) data and transporting it easily and efficiently from one tool, or one user, to another. The approach is titled “Data Package” because our work has close analogy with “containerization” in shipping and “packaging” in software.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPYRAV7m6h4
Tuesday,11:30:00,2,talk,bwebb,Ben Webb,Bidirectional conversion to/from CSV for nested JSON data,"A well defined nested format like JSON can be useful for defining a data standard. However, not everyone finds it easy to publish and consume JSON. For the Open Contracting and 360Giving data standards we've taken the hybrid approach of a canonical JSON representation with bidirectional conversion to/from spreadsheets. Since this involves converting between nested and flat representations we've called our software Flatten-Tool: https://github.com/OpenDataServices/flatten-tool/",
Wednesday,11:30:00,2,talk,jwass,Joe Wass,notsoBig Data: crunching Wikipedia referrer logs ,
Tuesday,11:30:00,3,talk,mjacomy,Mathieu Jacomy,"CSV, Rinse, Repeat","CSV is a common data format in social sciences and digital humanities, for instance a list of tweets that scholars want to analyze. However the most interesting data is often the most noisy. Filtering the content of a CSV is a necessity, but monitoring the process is an uneasy process since cleaning tools like Open Refine have poor visualization capabilities, and tools like Tableau Public are basic at filtering. In addition, no graphic interface is more efficient at filtering than a programming language like Javascript. At Sciences Po Paris médialab we often meet this problem and have decided to tackle it by developing a free and open source tool. ""CSV Rinse Repeat"" is a minimal web interface allowing you to upload a CSV and then iterate through filtering while keeping an eye on different visualizations. In a nutshell, you can filter the data represented as a javascript array while spawning simple d3 visualizations that synchronize with the output of your filtering. ""CSV Rinse Repeat"" functions well with Twitter data but accepts any kind of CSV. By leveraging the efficiency of Javascript and d3.js, data scientists can shortcut Ben Fry's famous data visualization process: ""Acquire, Parse, Filter, Mine, Represent, Refine, Interact"". We would be honored to present our tool and to share how we use it to explore large CSV data.

Wednesday,11:30:00,3,talk,amoser,Aurelia Moser,"This is Not a Map: Building Interactive Maps with CSVs, Creative Themes, and Curious Geometries","The meaning of ""map"" across disciplines is remarkably varied. It's effectively a spatial representation of geo-topography, a linking between tables by foreign key, a datatype in C++... Today, coders make creative use of custom basemaps, building remarkable maps of multivariate information off-the-(beaten) geographic projection. Many have designed and published interactive maps of cemetery burial plots, galactic drawings of the Star Wars Universe, sequence maps of human genes, heatmaps of court traffic during the NBA finals. For some of the most creative maps, ""artisanal"" CSV data is the vehicle for innovation in geocoding to non-traditional, historical, handmade basemaps. This talk will explore other maps, and investigate topics and themes not yet covered in interactives...detailing how to map them, and why mapping unmapped data might be the perfect expression of their meaning.",
Wednesday,12:00:00,1,talk,gmcmullen,Greg McMullen,A Public BigchainDB: A Blockchain Database for the Decentralized World Computer,"When we built BigchainDB, we always had in mind a public instance. We knew that along with projects like Ethereum and IPFS, we had a chance to make a major contribution to the dream of a fully decentralized Internet. This talk will discuss the benefits of a public blockchain database, the challenges in building a decentralized organization that is cohesive enough to administer itself without creating a central authority, and the potential for building the decentralized Internet.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXOH0D3no3k
Wednesday,12:00:00,2,talk,dbarnes,Darren Barnes,ONS Databaker: from 'pretty spreadsheets' to useful CSVs,"Out of the last CSV Conf, the Office for National Statistics hooked up with Scraper Wiki to produce a tool for more easily converting the traditional and all too common 'pretty spread sheet' into a much more open, machine readable and usable CSV format. This tool is called DataBaker and is freely available on GitHub. The tool is effectively a wrapper for the useful XYPath Python package also produced by Scraper Wiki and Data Baker allows easy creation of recipes to extract data from spreadsheets in a robust and flexible way. This talk will give a brief overview of the tool, how we use it at the ONS and how we see it moving forward (adding Linked Data URIs to the output fields?). We hope to engage community interest for adapting this tool for even wider use.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COnpIzF88WI

We would see high quality data because it would be relied on for user interaction. We would see reuse of data because it could be linked. That was my personal aim working on the W3C CSV on the Web standards.

Like CSVs, the Excel file format has been around for a long time, and has independently tried to solve many of the same problems the open data community is tackling now. For this talk, I’ll give an overview of how XLSX files work, the good ideas it has worth considering, as well as the warts best left behind.",

The logical structure of a dataset is decided by the dataset publisher. Common formats are the wide format, where variables are columns and the long format, where the variable name is itself a column entry. Mixtures of the two formats are also possible. We present our work on automatic detection of logical table structures, e.g. which variables are identifiers, which are categories and which are observations. We also present methods to automatically convert to a canonical format. Overall, we aim to reduce the amount of janitorial work currently required when ingesting data.

We also like second opinions.  Is it going to be good enough for analytics like forecasting or recommendations?  How do we avoid the dreaded ""garbage in, garbage out"" scenario?  What's the easiest way to get my colleagues to take a look?  I've been playing in Jupyter notebooks systems, specifically writing R code, a lot lately.  I use Jupyter for a scratch pad, testing environment, quick data exploration tool (with all the graphical power R has to offer) and most importantly I share these notebooks with others so they may play and explore, as well as offer their opinions.  I'm going to offer some logic behind collaborating with this simple, yet interactive, method of using Jupyter notebooks.

Tuesday,15:30:00,2,talk,pmarina,Princiya Marina,Data visualizations using D3.js and C++,"D3.js is a power tool for data visualizations. Data visualizations are only good if people see them, and there’s no better place to see them than on the internet, in your browser.

C++ is still considered a popular choice when it comes to programming and machine learning.

Node.js Addons are dynamically-linked shared objects, written in C or C++, that can be loaded into Node.js using the require() function, and used just as if they were an ordinary Node.js module. They are used primarily to provide an interface between JavaScript running in Node.js and C/C++ libraries.
I have built a framework which comprises of Node.js, C++ and D3.js for interactive web visualizations.

D3.js is a javascript library added to the front-end of any web application. The back-end (the server: Node.js and C++ library) will generate the necessary data. The part of the application the users interact with (the front-end) will use D3.js.

Using this approach, one can leverage the power of C++ for manipulating large data sets and D3.js for showing beautiful visualizations on the browser.",

We tend to provide information in one or at most a few languages, which makes it hard for speakers of all the other languages to access that same information.
This is also an issue on Wikipedia, a project widely and internationally used by all kind of people. But there are many topics that are only covered in few languages on Wikipedia. People who don’t speak any of these don’t have access to all the information available potentially vital to them.
In this talk I will show you how we can give more people more access to more knowledge by making use of Wikipedia’s reach and Wikidata’s multilingual data.
