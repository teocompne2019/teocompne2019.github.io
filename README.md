# CSVConf.com

A static site, [http://csvconf.com/](http://csvconf.com).

Forked from [martini](https://github.com/codegangsta/martini) gh-pages branch.

## Develop

This is a [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) site!

Requirements:

To work on the CSVConf site locally, you'll first need to have the following installed:

- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
- [Bundler](http://bundler.io/)

Once that's taken care of, here are the steps necessary to get it running locally:

1. clone this repository and `cd` into the `csvconf.com` directory
1. run the `bundle` command
1. run `bundle exec jekyll serve -w`

If everything worked, you should now have a local server running at http://localhost:4000. The `w` flag means the server will watch for changes and rebuild, so you can edit the site as needed and see the updated version in your browser right away.
