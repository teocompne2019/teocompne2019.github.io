		An ALC Description Logic Connection Calculus - Fred Freitas (UFPE), Jens Otten (University of Oslo)
		
	</summary>
	<p>
		This paper presents a connection calculus for 
		the description logic (DL) ALC. It replaces the 
		usage of Skolem terms and unification by additional 
		annotation and introduces blocking, a typical 
		feature of DL provers, by a new rule, to ensure 
		termination in the case of cyclic ontologies.

	<p>
		An edge coloring of the $n$-vertex complete graph 
		$K_n$ is a Gallai coloring if it does not contain 
		any rainbow triangle, that is, a triangle whose 
		edges are colored with three distinct colors. We 
		prove that the number of Gallai colorings of $K_n$ 
		with at most three colors is at most $7(n+1)2^{\binom{n}{2}}$, 
		which improves the best known upper bound of 
		$\frac{3}{2}(n - 1)!\cdot 2^{\binom{n-1}{2}}$

		We present a new result about the curse of dimensionality 
		affecting similarity search in intrinsically high-dimensional 
		metric spaces with measure, when an indexing scheme uses $1$-Lipschitz functions.
