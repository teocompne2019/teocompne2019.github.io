            <div class="bio">Christopher Gandrud is a post-doctoral fellow at the Hertie School of Governance and member of the rOpenGov community working to increase the openness of government and social science data.</div>
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            <p>Social scientists have access to many electronically available panel series datasets. However, downloading, cleaning, and merging them together is time-consuming and error-prone: for example, using <a href="http://www.carmenreinhart.com/data/">Reinhart and Rogoff's data</a> on the fiscal costs of the financial crisis involves downloading, cleaning, and merging four Excel files with over 70 individual sheets, one for each countryâ€™s data. Furthermore, because such datasets are not bundled in a format that is easy to manipulate, many of them are not updated on a regular basis.</p>
            <p>In this talk, we introduce the <code>psData</code> package for the <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R statistical software</a>. This package is being developed under the <a href="https://github.com/rOpenGov/">rOpenGov framework</a> to solve two problems:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>Time wasted by social scientists downloading, cleaning, and transforming commonly used data sets for their own research</li>
            <li>Errors introduced by data import and transformation scripts that are written individually and never shared across researchers</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The <code>psData</code> package aims to address these problems by distributing easy to use R functions for downloading, cleaning, and merging datasets used by social scientists. The package focuses on panel series data, which are frequently found in political science and macroeconomics. It is hosted on GitHub and can be easily added to and modified by the community, which will allow to fix and patch distributed datasets to all users simultaneously, improving overall data quality.</p>
            <p>The team behind the rOpenGov/psData project currently includes contributors from universities in five countries, and many will be present in Berlin at the time of the conference.</p>

            <p>I see two main issues in the common means of searching across data tables. One issue is that the search is localized to datasets that are published or otherwise managed by a particular entity, and another is that the search mechanism doesnâ€™t use information relating to the tabular structure of these data tables.</p>
            <p>We can do better! Comma search indexes as many data tables as you want, regardless of where theyâ€™re from, and it uses the tabular structure of these data tables to search for them. You provide a spreadsheet as input and receive a list of spreadsheets in return. In this talk, youâ€™ll learn how it works and how to use it.</p>

            <p>The advent of the Internet and heterogenous distributed software call for new tools for validating, documenting, coercing and transforming data. Surprisingly, conventional programming languages provide weak support for this because they strongly focus on behavior. Indeed, conventional type systems are designed towards fast code execution but only provides some type safety from a pure data perspective. In contrast, data requirements often require capturing precise data type definitions (e.g. the set of "integers less than 100", or the set {M,F}) but call for no behavior <i>per se</i>.</p>
            <p>This talk is about Finitio (<a href="http://finitio.io">finitio.io</a>), a language strongly biased towards data.

            <p>We would all like for our applications to run off dat-powered real-time feeds. More often than not, however, the data we serve doesn't change that often - or our data apps are one-off presentations anyway.</p>
            <p>In those cases, a dynamic server often isn't needed to power an application - they can just as well run off flat files and a cheap CDN. In this workshop I want to present some recipes and tools for making static file applications, but also have a discussion to learn from others and discuss some of the missing bits for making truly great flat-file apps.</p>

The result is an easily deployable, replicable and complete HTML5 data portal site.</p>

Now that more governments, agencies, and organizations are on board to release valuable data and information, what standards, guidelines, and other policy instruments need to be established in order to make that data useful to the public? Given that nations have similar data types, creating these policies with an international lens would create greater interoperability and lead to increased use. How do we get here? Who is the governance body? Come to this interactive presentation to share, learn, and move this conversation forward!</p>
